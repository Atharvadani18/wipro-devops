# Devops

Devops is a collaborative approach to software development and IT operations that aims to shorten the system development lifecylce while deilvering features, updates, and fixes frequently. 

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). The goal is to shorten the systems development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. 

Devops is not a technology or a tool, but a culture and a philosophy that encourages collaboration, communication, and integration between development and operations teams.
